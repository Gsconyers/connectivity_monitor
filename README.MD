This is a connection monitor that also launches traceroutes when an outage occurs to assist in diagnosing intermittant outages.
A few things I want to add:
1. Traces that do not get blocked by ICMP blocking
2. cross platform support
3. GUI

The licence is "Ask me if for some reason you want to use this."
